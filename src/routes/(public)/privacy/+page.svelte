          coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location
          of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and
          use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not
          function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

        <p class="prose">
          <strong>Invitations.</strong> If you use our invitation service to invite a third party to
          the Service we may ask you for that person's name, user ID, email address or other contact
          information and automatically send an invitation to the invitee. We store this information
          to send this invitation and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the
          invitee becomes a user of the Service, we do not use the invitee's contact information for
          marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee's contact information with third
          parties other than FirstShipper's service providers in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy. The invitee may contact us at
          <a href="mailto:privacy@firstshipper.com">privacy@firstshipper.com</a> at any time to request
          that we remove his or her information from our database. If you submit any personal information
          about other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority
          to do so and to allow us to use their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy (for example, by asking for their consent).

          <strong>Information we obtain from other third party sources.</strong> We may receive information
          about you from third parties, but only where we have received assurances from these third parties
          that they have either received your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required
          to disclose your Personal Information to us. For example, the customer relationship management
          software we use may supplement your contact information we have entered for you with information
          available from third party sources (e.g., LinkedIn). This information could include, but is
          not limited to any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and
          any information you have made public in connection with that service.

          may enable us to display advertisements based on your profile and corresponding use of the

          enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products

          too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to
