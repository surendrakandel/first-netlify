        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          LTL freight is a cost-effective way to ship pallets. LTL refers to “less than truckload”
          freight, which means that you'll be shipping pallets in a trailer with other items.
        </p>

        <p>
          LTL freight is one of the most popular options for small and medium-sized businesses who
          ship frequently but don't have the resources of larger corporations. The benefits of using
          an LTL carrier include lower prices compared to full truckload (FTL) shipments, increased
          flexibility in destinations and transit times, and reduced transportation costs per item
          shipped by sharing space with other customers' products on a truck or trailer headed in
          the same direction as yours. The disadvantages of using an LTL carrier are that you won't
          always have control over the exact route taken to get your freight from point A to point
          B, and there's a greater chance that it will be damaged in transit. Some companies also
          offer TL services, which means they'll send a truck out with just your cargo on
          board—which is usually cheaper than paying for all the space in a trailer (especially if
          you're shipping one or two pallets).
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding LTL Shipping</h3>

        <p>
          Freight shipping is an important part of any company’s supply chain. It can be a great
          source of revenue, but it also comes with some risk. That’s why it’s essential that you
          understand what LTL freight is and how it works before you commit to sending your products
          on the road.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some key points about LTL freight:</p>

        <p>
          Freight shipping involves transporting goods in a truck or trailer from one location to
          another. The difference between LTL freight and truckload (or TL) is that LTL uses smaller
          vehicles — trucks as small as 26 feet — while TL uses bigger ones ranging up to 53 feet
          long. This allows companies like FEDEX Ground, UPS Freight, or FedEx Freight to use their
          existing equipment when moving smaller amounts of goods across short distances within one
          area or city rather than transporting them between far-flung regions by rail or plane.
        </p>

        <h3>How LTL Freight Works</h3>

        <p>
          LTL freight is a flexible, cost-effective way to ship pallets. It's a great option for
          businesses that have large quantities of materials that are not time sensitive. LTL
          freight is also ideal for companies with high inventory needs, as it allows them to ship
          in small batches and have their products delivered quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>What Does LTL Shipping Cost?</h3>

        <p>
          To know the cost of your LTL freight shipment, you will need to know the weight and size
          of your shipment. You can find this information by using our shipping calculator. Here’s
          how:
        </p>

        Enter the zip code where you want to ship your pallets:

        <p>
          Select a carrier (like FedEx Freight or Roadway) for your region, who will transport it
          from one location to another:
        </p>

        <p>
          Select whether you would like them to pick up at origin, deliver to destination or provide
          both pickup and delivery services in one area before entering any other details about what
          needs shipping out there on their site:
        </p>

        <p>
          Once all information has been entered into our shipping calculator tool, click "Calculate
          Shipping Cost"button at bottom right corner of page as shown above
        </p>

        <h3>LTL freight is a flexible, cost-effective way to ship pallets.</h3>

        <p>
          LTL freight is a flexible, cost-effective way to ship pallets. It is ideal for small
          businesses that are shipping in volume and need to save money. LTL freight is also an
          excellent option for large businesses who want to ship multiple pallets at once, but don't
          want to pay the high costs associated with full truckload (FTL) shipments. Finally, LTL
          freight offers an affordable option for companies that frequently ship parcels because it
          allows you to move your inventory quickly without breaking the bank.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
          LTL shipping is a common way to ship freight across the country. It’s ideal for
          high-volume, low-weight shipments that need to be transported quickly. LTL shipping still
          uses trucks and drivers, but the difference is in how it’s packaged and shipped. LTL
          shipping is an economical and fast way to transport goods. It offers a variety of benefits
          that can help your business get the most out of every shipment, whether you’re shipping
          one pallet or 100 trucks full of freight. If you need personal assistance with your LTL
          freight shipment, contact us today!
